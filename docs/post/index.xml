      <description>It has been an awesome year for us for natural hatches. When birds are comfortable and happy, they do a much better job than our incubator ever could. We recently had a duck hatch 20 out of 20 eggs and today we just found this silky hen walking around with five chicks that look day old. It is a great surprise and the nice thing about a natural hatch is that we do not have to worry about setting up a brooder.</description>
