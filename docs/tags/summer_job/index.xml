      <description>Paid Summer Internship Opportunity We are looking for a summer intern to help us take care of our farm and expand our integrated duck and black soldier fly farming operation. This is a new and experimental concept that we are developing on our farm and we believe it is a great way to produce high quality and delicious food for our local market, right here in Kamloops.
Details The position starts in May, and lasts for approximately four months, however we need to identify the individual we will be hiring before Monday April 16th.</description>
