      <description>We are hiring! We are looking for a summer intern to help us take care of our farm and expand our integrated duck and black soldier fly farming operation. This is a new and experimental concept that we are developing on our farm and we believe it is a great way to produce high quality and delicious meat for our local market, right here in Kamloops.
Our farm is growing and it is becoming increasingly risky for the two of us to be the only people knowing how to run the farm.</description>
