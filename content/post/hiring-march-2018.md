# We are hiring!

We are looking for a summer intern to help us take care of our farm and expand our integrated duck and black soldier fly farming operation. This is a new and experimental concept that we are developing on our farm and we believe it is a great way to produce high quality and delicious meat for our local market, right here in Kamloops.

Our farm is growing and it is becoming increasingly risky for the two of us to be the only people knowing how to run the farm. Currently we have over 300 birds, 17 sheep, 4 guardian dogs (expecting more), 2 pregnant sows, and by the end of April we will have over a million black soldier fly larvae which we use as feed for our poultry.  

## When
The position starts at the beginning of May, and lasts for approximately 4 months, however we need to identify the individual we will be hiring before end of March.

We are looking for a moivated individual who is passionate about small scale farming and food sovereignty. Previous farm experience is not required but would be an asset. However, working on a farm is not for the faint of heart. Here is a checklist to see if this internship might be suitable for you:

* Must not be afraid of poop

* Must not be afraid of shovel
* Must be willing to work with many different farm animals
