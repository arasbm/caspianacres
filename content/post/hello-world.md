It has been an awesome year for us for natural hatches. When birds are comfortable and happy, they do a much better job than our incubator ever could. We recently had a duck hatch 20 out of 20 eggs and today we just found this silky hen walking around with five chicks that look day old.
It is a great surprize and the nice thing about a natural hatch is that we do not have to worry about setting up a brooder.

On another note, We decided to create a website to keep you posted about our progress on the farm. This is our first post. Please stay in touch and we will post more updates soon.
