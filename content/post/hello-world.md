It has been an awesome year for us for natural hatches. When birds are comfortable and happy, they do a much better job than our incubator ever could. We recently had a duck hatch 20 out of 20 eggs and today we just found this silky hen walking around with five chicks that look day old. It is a great surprise and the nice thing about a natural hatch is that we do not have to worry about setting up a brooder.

Having so many healthy and strong free range chickens around, means that our farm is not always a safe place for day old chicks to walk around out in the open. We moved mom and the chicks to a cage and placed a cardboard box in there for them. They are much happier now and love to rest in the cardboard box. They will spend a week or two here until they are a bit bigger and ready to join the real world. We plan to build a covered outdoor areas for this purpuse in future, but for now placing them in a cage does the trick.

On another note, We decided to create this blog to keep you posted about our advantures on the farm. This is our first post. Please stay in touch and we will post more updates soon. Our next post will be about ducks, because ducks are awesome!
