# Ok Kamloops, you need to eat more ducks!

> "We raise happy free range ducks right here in Kamloops and believe it or not, you can buy them and eat them! What is even more crazy is that they are good for you and the environment."

When it comes to choosing good, nutritious and healthy food, most people usually talk about fresh local vegetables. It is not very often that you would hear meat and eggs suggested as healthy food choices. It is even less common to find people who know how great ducks can be. There are a lot of misconceptions around ducks and we are here to change your opinion about them.

When Anastasia and I moved out to the country three years ago, we had one goal in mind. We wanted to create a farm that produces more than what it takes in, and one that progressively improves the land instead of degrading it. We chose a dry piece of land with rolling hills covered with sagebrush with very poor soil and very little water. It was going to be challenging to grow any food on this land, but all we were after was a starting point. We knew that raising animals would be the key to turn things around. We did not know what animals would best support a regenerative system on our farm, and since we wanted a diversified farm, we set out to raise several different types of animals including sheep, pigs, guinea fowl, chickens, turkeys, insects and of course ducks.

While we tried to learn how each type of animal interacts with our farm system; we were looking for a few key players to focus on so that we could create a self sufficient and profitable farm business. This is important so that we could continue living a healthy life and take good care of our farm animals while producing food for the local market. One of the best choices we have made on our farm so far has been choosing to raise ducks. Here are some of the reasons why ducks are so awesome:

## Ducks are very resilient

One of our core principles for our farm is that we want to work with nature and not against it. That means that all of our animals are free range and fully participate in nature. They can eat bugs and hang out with wild birds. Ducks score very high in this category because they have very strong natural resistance against pests and disease and they especially thrive in our climate and perform much better compared to other poultry such as chickens or turkeys. We can raise several hundred ducks outdoors without using any medication or chemicals to try to protect them against disease. Even during harshest winter conditions, ducks love to go out and play in the snow.



## Ducks are very good mothers

Spring is always a fun season at our farm. Every week we find ducks emerging out of their nests with a dozen or so ducklings. If ducks are happy and well fed, they naturally grow their population very fast. This is very good because it means we do not have to spend a lot of energy and time keeping the ducklings warm and safe.

## Ducks are delicious!

I can give you many more reasons why ducks are a great fit for local regenerative food production, but what better reason to choose ducks than the fact that they are absolutely delicious. The only catch is that you need to know how to prepare ducks. However, do not worry, we have you covered. Currently you can find our ducks locally on the menu at [Brownstone Restaurant](http://www.brownstone-restaurant.com/). If you have not been there, you should definitely check them out. We love working with Brownstone because they genuinely support local farmers and develop long term working relationships with them.

We really enjoy working with brownstone especially seeing their respect for food and the fact that they use all parts of the animal. We provide Brownstone with whole ducks and they create a beautiful and delicious meal with it that is not only good for your instagram feed, but also very nutritious and healthy. Your gut with thank you for eating this food and hopefully you will find comfort in knowing that you are supporting a small local regenerative and diversified farm.

We should also let you know that you can find our duck eggs on the supper menu at Red Beard Cafe. We have had duck eggs a hundred different ways, but this is one of our favourite duck egg dishes. If you find yourself at Red Beard Cafe after 5pm and you are hungry, order the Caspian Acres duck egg on flat bread for a delicious and filling meal.
