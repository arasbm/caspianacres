The main input to our system is fresh organic waste that we collect from local restaurants, [Kamloops Food Bank](http://kamloopsfoodbank.org/) or leftovers from big social events such as [Ribfest](http://kamloopsribfest.com/). We divert these waste streams that were otherwise destined for landfill and use it to create high quality feed for our animals and generate soil at the same time. Some of the produce scraps, such as vegitables and fruit, goes directly to pigs, chickens and ducks. Most of the organic waste is consumed by our black soldier fly larvae, which is a great source of protein calcium and other essential nutrients, are fed to ducks and chickens.

We strive to produce high quality food for our local community in Cherry Creek and Kamloops while taking good care of our animals. It is very important to us that all of our animals are happy and healthy, therefore we only have a small amount of eggs and meat to offer. Our birds are free range and our laying hens get to hang out on our farm as long as they live. Feel free to follow us on social media and we will let you know when we can take on new customers.
